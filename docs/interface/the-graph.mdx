# The Graph

To retrieve data from the graph in the interface we use two important folders:

- services/apiTheGraph: in the index file are the configurations to communicate with the graph's client. We created a subfolder to assemble the queries and make the requests for each entity mapped in the graph.

- hooks/apiTheGraphHooks: we create a subfolder for each hook that can be used to call the service request and return the information of a certain entity

So, to use the information from the graph, just use the hook on any dapp page.
