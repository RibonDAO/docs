# Tools used to test
We are currently using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) to test our components.
Feel free to see their docs to know more about them. In the next sections we will cover the main ways to test our interface.

## Components

We have a component directory in `src/components`. There you should create only components that receive props and have a state.
They are not coupled to any hooks, contexts or application related code.
You can think of this `components` directory as a library that could be copied to any other project and still work.

There you normally test the behavior of your component. For example, for a `<Button />` component we could test if the props passed to it are showed in the screen
and if it calls the right function when it is pressed. You can check the test for the `<Button />` component in the `src/components/atomics/Button/index.test.tsx` file in the project.
It is a good reference of what to test on components.
