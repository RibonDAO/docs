# Tools

## Sentry

We use Sentry as a tool for managing errors in our app. You can check it out at this [link](https://sentry.io/auth/login/ribon/). You can only be added to it by e-mail, so you would have to ask someone to include you there. 

## Hopscotch

This is a tool similar to Insomnia and Postman, but with a bonus of being easily accessible from the browser, as you can see on this [link](https://hoppscotch.io). You can use requests that were already written by somebody else and share your own requests with the team, saving everybody some time when testing requests and their responses.

## Metamask

As a Web3 startup based on Polygon, an EVM-compatible sidechain, we use Metamask as our wallet provider, so you may want to install it (if you haven't already) on this [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).
