# Intro to our tools

Alphabetically, so it's easier to find what you're looking for  :wink:

## Analytics

Here we use Analytics as most people do: to analyze data and get insights that help us make more informed decisions. You can learn more about it [here](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision) and on our ["Firebase Events" page](firebase-events). 

At Ribon, we use events to keep track of users interactions with our app. On the frontend you will see many `logEvent("someEvent")` on the pages. 
When using this, make sure each event fires only once (using `console.log()` to test it may be a good idea). 

To access the data related to that event, you can enter the Firebase project of the app you want to check then click on the "events" option on the bar to the left.

## AWS

## Firebase

## GraphQL

## Hopscotch

This is a tool similar to Insomnia and Postman, but with a bonus of being easily accessible from the browser, as you can see on this [link](https://hoppscotch.io). You can use requests that were already written by somebody else and share your own requests with the team, saving everybody some time when testing requests and their responses.

## Metamask

In case you are not so familiar with cryptocurrencies, you may want to know that there is a digital wallet where we people keep their tokens, such as ETH, BTC, USDT, etc. As a Web3 startup based on Polygon, an EVM-compatible sidechain, we use Metamask as our wallet provider, so you may want to install it (if you haven't already) on this [link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn).

## Redis

## Sendgrid

Sendgrid is API used for sending e-mails. You can check their docs [here](https://docs.sendgrid.com/pt-br/).

## Sentry

We use Sentry as a tool for managing errors in our app. You can check it out at this [link](https://sentry.io/auth/login/ribon/). You can only be added to it by e-mail, so you would have to ask someone to include you there.
